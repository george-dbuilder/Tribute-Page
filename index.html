      <h2 class="article">A tribute to remember those who lost their lives working in hospitals and care homes during the coronavirus pandemic.</h2>
      <p class="article">
      More than 25,000 healthcare workers have contracted the coronavirus.
      </p>
      <p class="article">Many doctors, nurses, EMTs, and  support staff had been forced to reuse their personal protective equipment during their shifts, making them especially susceptible to the virus.</p>
      <p class="article">
      As front-line healthcare workers care for patients with COVID-19, they commit themselves to difficult, draining work and also put themselves at risk of infection. Thousands throughout the world have died.
      <p class="article">
      Doctors, nurses, carers, porters, cleaners and paramedics are among those who have died after being infected with COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      Behind each number is the death of a beloved family member and colleague.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Their sacrifice would forever not be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        With that in mind, we pay tribute to these people who have died and tell their stories.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
